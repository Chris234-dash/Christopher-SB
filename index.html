                'Random Forest Regressor for robust predictions',

            fullDescription: `
                <p class="mb-4">In the world of financial markets, accurate forecasting is a significant challenge. While standard methods like Monte Carlo simulations are widely used, I observed that they often fall short. My analysis of Monte Carlo simulations showed that they can produce overly simplified results, with optimistic scenarios reaching unrealistic highs and median predictions that often fail to capture the nuances of market sentiment. This realization became the catalyst for a personal project I undertook: to build a more sophisticated and reliable price prediction tool that moves beyond pure statistical randomness and incorporates a deep understanding of market dynamics through machine learning.</p>
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">A Data-Driven Approach to Financial Forecasting</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project involved a complete development cycle, from foundational research and method selection to building, backtesting, and implementing a new predictive model. My approach was centered on creating a multi-scenario forecasting engine that leverages advanced feature engineering and a powerful machine learning algorithm to generate a more realistic and actionable range of potential future prices.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">I. Preliminary Research & Method Selection</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The foundation of this project was a preliminary research phase to identify influential parameters and robust analytical methods from the fields of quantitative finance and digital signal processing. The goal was to select a combination of tools that could effectively model both trend/momentum and cyclical market behaviors.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Core Machine Learning Engine:</strong> My research into predictive algorithms for non-linear, noisy data like financial prices led me to ensemble methods. I selected the Random Forest Regressor for its robustness, its ability to capture complex relationships without overfitting, and its stability, which comes from averaging the results of hundreds of individual decision trees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundational Indicators:</strong> I identified a baseline set of industry-standard technical indicators known for their proven effectiveness in measuring market state. This included the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum, Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for long-term trend, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for trend changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Cyclical Analysis:</strong> To address the core limitation of simpler models, my research focused on methods to objectively identify and analyze market cycles. This led me to select a two-part approach from digital signal processing: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to decompose historical price data and quantitatively identify the dominant, most influential cycle period, and Hilbert Transform to analyze the current price action within the context of the dominant cycle identified by the FFT, determining its instantaneous phase (e.g., uptrend, downtrend) and amplitude.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">II. Model Validation & Backtesting</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">With the core methods selected, the next critical step was to validate the model's logic. Before using it for forecasting, I conducted a rigorous backtesting process against historical data. This involved training the model and then testing its ability to predict prices in a subsequent period it had not seen before. The results were highly successful and validated the model's effectiveness: Average Monthly Absolute Error: The model demonstrated an exceptionally low average error rate of just 0.91% per month. Model Confidence Level: This translates to a monthly accuracy or confidence level of 99.09%. The close alignment between the model's predictions and the actual historical prices confirmed that the chosen architecture was sound.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">III. Multi-Scenario System Architecture</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The validated components from my research were then assembled into a sophisticated, multi-scenario architecture. This system generates three distinct forecasts by feeding different layers of analytical features into the Random Forest engine, thereby modeling different levels of market conviction: Basic Momentum, Advance Momentum, and Advance Momentum and Cycle.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">IV. Forecasting Results: A BTC-USD Case Study</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">I implemented the entire system in Python. To demonstrate the tool's capability, I ran a 5-year (1825-day) forecast for Asset X from 16 July 2025, which yielded the following results: Basic Momentum: Predicted a price of $638,264.92 (CAGR: +39.76%). Advance Momentum: Predicted a price of $1,114,360.53 (CAGR: +56.25%). Advance Momentum and Cycle: Predicted a price of $278,110.01 (CAGR: +18.35%).</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">V. Project Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Through this project, I successfully developed a sophisticated, multi-scenario forecasting tool that addresses the key limitations of traditional prediction models. By conducting thorough preliminary research and strategically layering analytical techniquesâ€”from foundational indicators to advanced cyclical analysisâ€”this tool provides a more nuanced, realistic, and ultimately more useful range of potential future outcomes for financial assets.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">VI. Acknowledged Limitations and Future Development</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">While the model has proven effective in its backtesting, I recognize its limitations and areas for future development. This is an ongoing project that can be further enhanced. Data Quality Dependency: The model's predictive power is fundamentally tied to the quality and accuracy of the historical input data. Performance on High-Volatility Assets: For assets characterized by extreme volatility and erratic price movements, the probability of model error increases, as such assets may be driven by factors not fully captured by the model. Adapting to Evolving Markets: The model is trained on past data. Its ability to accurately predict outcomes in a market that is undergoing a fundamental shift in behavior (e.g., "maturing") is a known challenge that requires ongoing research. Evolving Methodologies: The field of quantitative finance and machine learning is constantly advancing. This model is based on established methods, but I acknowledge that my research may not encompass the absolute latest, cutting-edge algorithms. Disclaimer: This tool is intended as a proof-of-concept and an analytical reference, not as a primary source for financial advice. All investment decisions should be made with independent research and professional guidance.</p>

            fullDescription: `
                <p class="mb-4">Born from my deep personal interest and continuous independent research into financial markets, this project was created to address a critical challenge for any investor: how to allocate capital across a portfolio of diverse assets optimally. My experience has shown that selecting good individual assets is only half the battle; structuring them into a resilient and efficient portfolio is paramount. My goal was to build a comprehensive, interactive program that guides an investor through the entire portfolio management workflowâ€”from screening candidate assets to optimizing allocations based on their risk profile, and finally, projecting the portfolio's future growth.</p>
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">A Structured Approach to Portfolio Management</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project was implemented as a complete, end-to-end command-line tool in Python. It is designed to walk a user through a structured, four-step process: (1) Asset Screening, (2) Portfolio Optimization, (3) Rebalancing Action Plan, and (4) Probabilistic Forecasting. The architecture is built on a specific design philosophy aimed at creating a tool that is not only quantitatively robust but also practical and flexible for real-world use.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">I. Methodological Rationale & Design Philosophy</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Before building the tool, I conducted research to select methodologies that would address the practical needs of a modern investor and overcome the limitations of simpler models. The following design choices form the foundation of this project: Why a Hybrid Data Model? My primary consideration was flexibility. I designed the tool to accept both automated data via Yahoo Finance and manual user input for key metrics (CAGR, Volatility). This allows for a truly holistic portfolio analysis that reflects an investor's entire net worth, not just their stock holdings. Why Pre-Screen Assets by Risk Profile? Before optimization, the tool screens and ranks candidate assets based on the user's stated risk profile. I implemented this step to align the asset selection with the investor's core philosophy from the outset. By filtering candidates based on Volatility (for Conservative), Sharpe Ratio (for Moderate), or CAGR (for Aggressive), the tool ensures that the final optimized portfolio is constructed from assets that are already philosophically aligned with the user's goals. Why Resampled Efficient Frontier? For the core optimization, I chose the Resampled Efficient Frontier method over classic Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO). Resampling combats the instability of classic MVO by running hundreds of simulations and averaging the results, producing portfolios that are more robust, stable, and diversified. Why Monte Carlo Simulation for Forecasting? I added the Monte Carlo simulation as the final step to translate the characteristics of the optimized portfolio into a dynamic, forward-looking probabilistic forecast. It answers the crucial question: "Given this optimal asset mix, what is the probable range of my portfolio's value in the future?"</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">II. The Asset Allocation Engine: From Optimization to Actionable Choice</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This is the analytical core of the program. After running the Resampled Efficient Frontier optimization, the tool does not simply provide one answer; it generates a spectrum of three distinct, actionable portfolio allocations. This is designed to give the user a clear understanding of the risk-reward trade-offs: The Konservatif Portfolio, The Agresif Portfolio, and The Moderat Portfolio.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">III. Implementation & Detailed Case Study Results</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">To demonstrate the tool's practical application, I ran a case study with the following setup: an existing portfolio of Rp 1,800,000 in Asset A, Rp 3,000,000 in new capital, a "Moderat" risk profile, and a universe of 8 candidate assets. Asset Screening & Optimization: The tool first selected Asset A (Sharpe Ratio: 1.06) and Asset B (Sharpe Ratio: 0.57) as the top candidates. It then generated the three optimal portfolios as described above. Rebalancing Plan: As the chosen profile was "Moderat," the program generated a clear action plan to align the holdings with the 60.84% / 39.16% target. It advised the user to "TAMBAH/BELI" (Add/Buy) Rp 1,120,437 worth of Asset A and "TAMBAH/BELI" Rp 1,879,563 worth of the newly added Asset B.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">IV. Forward-Looking Analysis: Monte Carlo Simulation of the Optimal Portfolio</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">After defining the optimal "Moderat" portfolio, the tool's final step was to run a forward-looking stress test using a 15,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation provided a rich, probabilistic view of what the investor could expect from this specific allocation. The 5-year forecast was particularly insightful: In a Median (P50) scenario, the portfolio was projected to achieve a nominal growth of +201.32%. Even after accounting for a high 9% annual inflation rate, the expected real growth was an impressive +95.83%. In a Pessimistic (P5) scenario, the portfolio's nominal value was projected to decline by only -10.67% over the full five years, providing a clear measure of downside risk. Most importantly, the simulation calculated a 93.23% probability of the portfolio generating a profit over the 5-year period. This single, intuitive metric provides a powerful confidence level for the chosen investment strategy.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Project Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project successfully integrates several advanced financial theories into a single, user-friendly, and practical tool. It guides an investor from a disorganized list of candidate assets to a statistically robust, optimized portfolio tailored to their risk profile, complete with a clear rebalancing plan and a probabilistic forecast of its future performance. By deliberately choosing methodologies like the Resampled Efficient Frontier and a hybrid data model, the tool provides a sophisticated yet accessible solution to the fundamental challenge of portfolio allocation and management.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">From my experience analyzing financial markets, I have learned that the most critical first step, before any attempt at price forecasting, is a deep and objective understanding of an asset's inherent risk. I believe that jumping directly to price prediction without first quantifying historical volatility, the potential for significant losses (drawdown), and true risk-adjusted performance can lead to misguided investment decisions. This conviction, born from personal experience, was the catalyst for this project. My goal was to build a comprehensive Python-based program that could serve as a robust foundational tool in any investment analysis process, focusing first and foremost on creating a clear, data-driven overview of an asset's risk and reward profile.</p>
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">A Quantitative Approach to Investment Analysis</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project was developed as a user-interactive command-line tool in Python. Its core philosophy is to acknowledge the limitations of short-term data head-on. Rather than producing a simple numerical output, the tool's primary function is to serve as an "interpretive engine." It calculates key risk-reward metrics and immediately translates them into a detailed narrative analysis, complete with qualitative assessments and crucial warnings about data scarcity.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">I. System Architecture & Key Features</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">To tackle the challenge of limited data, I designed the program with several key features that differentiate it from standard analysis tools:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Flexible, Interactive Data Input:</strong> A core design feature is its manual data input system, built to handle assets without a public data feed or with very short histories. The process is straightforward and flexible.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Interpretive Engine (Dynamic Analysis):</strong> This is the program's most innovative feature. After calculating the metrics (CAGR, MDD, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio), it automatically generates detailed, qualitative analysis in plain language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Built-in Extrapolation Warning:</strong> Recognizing the danger of annualizing short-term data, I built a critical safeguard into the tool. It automatically detects if the input data spans less than a year and, if so, issues a clear warning that all annualized figures are extrapolations and should be interpreted with caution.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">II. Implementation & Case Study on a Young Asset</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">To demonstrate the tool's capabilities, I ran a case study on "Asset Y," a hypothetical young asset with only six months of monthly performance data. After selecting the 'monthly' frequency, I entered the six data points one by one. The tool then generated the following detailed analysis: Performance Analysis, Risk Profile Assessment, Risk-Adjusted Return Ratios, and a Final Warning due to the short data span.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Project Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project resulted in a specialized and highly practical tool for the rapid analysis of young or data-scarce assets. Its unique contribution is not merely the calculation of metrics, but its interpretive engine, which translates complex quantitative data into an immediate, contextualized narrative. By combining a flexible data input system with automated analysis and built-in safeguards, the tool empowers a user to make more informed and risk-aware decisions, even when faced with the uncertainty of new investment opportunities.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">This project involved developing a dual-function command-line tool. The first function is a deep dive into an asset's historical data to calculate and interpret a suite of key performance and risk metrics. The second function uses the asset's historical characteristics to run a Monte Carlo simulation, generating a probabilistic forecast of its future price across multiple scenarios. The entire system is designed to deliver a 360-degree quantitative snapshot of an asset's character, complete with automated qualitative assessments.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">I. Comprehensive Risk & Performance Analysis Engine</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The core of the program is its ability to perform a multi-faceted analysis of an asset's historical price data. I designed specific Python functions to calculate several industry-standard metrics to create a holistic risk profile, including Advanced Drawdown Analysis, Risk-Adjusted Returns (Sharpe & Sortino Ratios), Volatility and Value at Risk (VaR), and Performance and Trend Metrics.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">II. Probabilistic Forecasting with Monte Carlo Simulation</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The second function of the tool is to project a range of potential future outcomes using the Monte Carlo simulation method. My reasoning for choosing this method was to establish a robust, statistically sound baseline for future price paths. The simulation uses historical daily log returns to run thousands of randomized simulations, aggregated to produce P95 (Optimistic), P50 (Median), and P5 (Pessimistic) scenarios, along with a calculated probability of profit.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The framework was implemented as a user-interactive command-line tool in Python. A full analysis on Asset X produced detailed quantitative results and automated interpretations. The synthesized metrics suggested that Asset X is undergoing market maturation, transitioning from a high-growth to a more mature phase. Despite the high historical risk and slowing growth, the asset remains attractive, evidenced by a strong CAGR and robust risk-adjusted returns.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Project Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This project resulted in the successful development of a powerful, dual-function tool for quantitative asset analysis. It serves as an essential first step in any investment process by offering a clear, data-driven narrative of an asset's historical risk/reward profile, complemented by a probabilistic view of its future potential. This tool effectively establishes the "character" of an asset, allowing for more informed decisions based on a philosophy of understanding risk first.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">While this framework provides a robust quantitative snapshot, I recognize its inherent limitations and areas for future enhancement, such as the assumption of stationarity in the Monte Carlo simulation and performance on high-volatility assets.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">For my final thesis project, I tackled a complex, real-world optimization challenge rooted in Bali's thriving tourism industry. As Indonesia's primary tourist destination, accounting for over 75% of foreign arrivals, this rapid growth presents significant challenges. The Tour and Travel Agencies (BPW), which serve approximately 50% of these visitors, are at the nexus of this complexity. They face a crucial trilemma: maximizing tourist satisfaction by creating rich itineraries, minimizing operational costs and travel time, and adhering to the Indonesian government's ambitious goal of halving tourism-related carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">My research was born from identifying the critical factors that complicate this balancing act. Firstly, Bali's traffic is highly dynamic; travel time between two points can vary dramatically. Secondly, there is a rising global consciousness around sustainable travel. My thesis aimed to develop and implement a sophisticated optimization model to provide BPWs with a data-driven tool to navigate these competing objectives effectively.</p>
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">A Holistic Approach to Itinerary Optimization</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">My research methodology was comprehensive, beginning with problem identification through interviews with a local BPW in Bali and culminating in the development of a fully functional, interactive web-based decision support system. The project integrated advanced mathematical modeling, metaheuristic algorithms, and robust data analysis.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">I. Problem Formulation & Mathematical Modeling</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The core of my work was formulating a mathematical model based on the Green Orienteering Problem with Time-Dependent (GOPTD) framework. This model is built on three essential pillars: Orienteering Problem (OP), a Green Component (minimizing CO2), and Time-Dependent Factors for traffic. The final objective function was designed as a multi-objective maximization problem: max Z = Q1(Satisfaction) - Q2(Cost) - Q3(Emissions).</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">II. Data Collection & Preparation</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">To power the model, I collected and processed a wide range of data: Destination Data for 120 tourist destinations in Bali, Vehicle Parameters for a Toyota Hiace, and Time-Dependent Data for traffic congestion using Google Maps simulations.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">III. Solution Algorithm & Implementation</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Due to the NP-hard nature of this problem, I used Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and a 2-Opt Local Search algorithm. To translate this model into a practical tool, I developed and deployed a fully interactive web-based decision support system using Python, Streamlit, Folium, and ngrok.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">IV. Results & Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The model was successfully executed and validated. For a case study of a 16-hour tour, the model produced an optimal route visiting 8 distinct tourist locations, with a final objective score of 17.8936. The annual carbon saving was equivalent to the amount absorbed by 91 trees. My sensitivity analysis revealed the most critical parameters influencing the final route.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Project Conclusion and Professional Development</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">My thesis successfully demonstrates the effective application of a GOPTD model to solve the complex challenge of tourist itinerary planning in Bali. The project's primary contribution is a functional decision support tool that translates complex mathematical theory into a practical application for BPWs. A key strategic benefit of this model is its ability to position BPWs to capitalize on the powerful and growing trend of "green" or "sustainable tourism".</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Acknowledged Limitations and Future Research Directions</h4>
